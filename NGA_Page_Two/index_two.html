        If you clicked around the min and max ages enough, you might have seen a
        repeat artist in multiple decades. German photographer Ilse Bing was the
        youngest artist in the 1910s, and one of the oldest artists in the
        1980s. Both images are self portraits, but the image that she made at 89
        was a collage, a style she experimented with later in life. The collage
        features an image of her when she was younger and in a way, acts like
        the visualization itself. In one image, we see a snapshot of an artist
        both at the start of their creative life and at the end of it.

        To highlight this insight, I decided to give Ilse Bing a personal
        timeline, featuring all of her work in the NGA collection. Born in
        Frankfurt in 1899, Bing began her photographic pursuits early in life
        after she was given a Kodak box camera at age 14. Pioneering in
        avant-garde photography, Bing worked extensively in cities such as
        Frankfurt, Paris, and New York. In addition to numerous portraits, Bing
        was primarily interested in urban motifs. She was fascinated by
        architectural elements and structures as well as urban hustle and
        bustle. Her way of working repeatedly explores the tracing of symmetry
        and rhythm in the experience of everyday situations. Reflections can
        often be found in her work as well, like in rain puddles, rivers and
        seas. <br /><br /><strong
